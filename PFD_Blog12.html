            Week 12
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            After a long 7 week break from our 1st hackathon, it was time to continue with the PFD Assignment. Over the
            7 weeks, our team decided not to work on the project as many of our teammates had exams and projects to
            submit. On the first Wednesday of the week, our team met up in class face-to-face where we discuss the
            improvement that will be implemented. We looked back at our lecturers' and OCBC coachs' feedback during the
            hackathon and had to brainstorm how to improve our current application.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            By considering the feedbacks given and brainstorming ourselves, we have came up with several different
            features/improvements that can be implemented.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            Firstly, we plan to implement scheduled transaction, which
            would allow users to schedule a trasaction at a later date.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            Secondly, Giro transaction will allow users to
            connect themselves with a billing organisation, which will allow the billing organisation to initiate a
            transaction to pay bills or taxes.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            Thirdly, a QR code transfer method will be implemented. This would allow
            users to scan a recipient's QR code to transfer money, reducing the need to fill in the recipient's account
            number, IC number or phone number.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            Fourthly, a discord notification system will be implemented that will
            notify users about errors and transactions made.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            Fifthly, we will be changing our code architechure to allow
            multiple account holders to hold several bank accounts such as savings account, checking account or
            retirement account.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            Sixthly, the database will be migrated to Azure's PostgreSQL database (This will be
            explain in later weeks).
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            Seventhly, a CRUD application will be built which would allow OCBC staff and
            developers to access the database to troubleshoot issues.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            Eightly, a MAC address tracking will be implemented so that the system will be able to track if the account
            has been accessed from another device and notify users about unauthorised logins.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            Ninethly, NFC transaction was will allow users to transfer money by tapping each other's phone. This would
            allow money to be transfered very quickly as the recipient's information does not need to be typed in.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            Lastly, more validation will be applied to the existing code base and the newly implemented features
        </div>
