            Week 16
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            To conclude through this 10 weeks of development (week 1-5 and 12-16), I have learnt how to manage a team to
            plan, build and improve on a project. As a team leader, I had to take initiative to push my teammates, keep
            track of date lines, understand both front-end and back-end fully and more.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            PFD has thought me use pick up new skills and use technologies to solve real-world problem. From this
            module, I learnt how to use Azure's webapp and database services, use Flask to host a server. Furthermore, I
            have also learnt how to develop a solution with both fron-end and back-end elements seperated.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            I have also learnt to trust my teammates that they are able to implement their respective features. As this
            semester has been the hardest and most busy for me and the PFD project is very large, the project had to be
            seperated into disctince sections where it is difficult for me to keep track of the Android team's progress.
        </div>
        <div class="description-block">
            By trusting and working with my teammates, I believe that we achieve more together as compared if we worked
            seperately. To conclude, I really enjoy this PFD experience and hope to attend more external hackathons like
            the Shoppee Code League in the future.
